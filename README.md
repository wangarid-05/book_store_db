#Project Summary: Bookstore Database Management System

Overview:
As part of this group project, I successfully designed and implemented a MySQL database to manage a variety of operations for a bookstore. The database was structured to store essential information about books, authors, customers, orders, shipping, and more, providing a system for efficiently managing and retrieving large amounts of data.
